What is DOM?

DOM is Document Object Model. 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface used to represent and interact with the 
structure of HTML, XML, and XHTML documents. It provides a way for programs to dynamically access, 
manipulate, and update the content, structure, and style of web pages in real-time. In simpler terms, 
it's like a map that lets web developers navigate and modify the elements of a webpage using code.


Why we use DOM?

1. Interactivity: DOM enables dynamic changes to web content, making web pages interactive.

2. Element Manipulation: It allows developers to easily modify and manipulate individual elements on a webpage.

3. Browser Compatibility: DOM ensures consistent functionality across different web browsers.

4. Data Binding: Developers can efficiently update content by binding data to specific DOM elements.

5. Accessibility: DOM supports enhancements for better accessibility, aiding users with disabilities.
