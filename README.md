# 100-Days-of-Code

Welcome to the "100 Days of Code" challenge! This repository documents my journey as I embark on a 100-day coding challenge focused on revising and mastering various aspects of JavaScript, web development, and version control using Git and GitHub. The primary goal of this challenge is to enhance my proficiency in JavaScript, explore web APIs, delve into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, and master the React.js library. Additionally, I will be strengthening my skills in version control with Git and GitHub.

## Introduction

Programming is a journey of continuous learning and improvement. This repository serves as a logbook for my "100 Days of Code" challenge, where I'll be dedicating time each day to code, learn, and grow as a developer. The primary focus of this challenge is to revisit and reinforce my knowledge of JavaScript, explore advanced topics, and dive deep into web development concepts, specifically React.js. Alongside these, I will be working on strengthening my version control skills using Git and GitHub.

## Goals

- **JavaScript Mastery:** Revise and strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, covering basic to advanced topics.
- **Web APIs:** Explore and implement web APIs to understand their usage and integration with web applications.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript:** Delve into OOP concepts in JavaScript, understanding how to write modular and maintainable code.
- **React.js Proficiency:** Master the React.js library by building projects and gaining hands-on experience.
- **Git and GitHub:** Enhance my version control skills, understand branching strategies, and collaborate effectively on GitHub.
